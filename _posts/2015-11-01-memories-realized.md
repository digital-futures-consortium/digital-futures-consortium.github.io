brief: Memory, events, and personal objects are the focus of research in many disciplines and at the same time they document cultural and social history. Scholars produce online archives from this work that include film, still images, and documents, adding to scholarly resources available for further research. This panel session will describe the sometimes complicated process by which cultural heritage data enters digital archives, and in particular, how people's memories become data.
