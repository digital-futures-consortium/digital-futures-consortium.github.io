<p>
  Join the Digital Futures Consortium for a participatory workshop on visualizing data and understanding the powerful role it plays in analysis and presentation for digital scholarship. The workshop will feature brief presentations, a hands-on exercise working with a dataset and visualization tools to create a visual presentation, and a discussion followed by pizza. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own data projects or challenges for an open lab session afterward. No programming or data expertise is necessary.
</p>

<p>
  The workshop is free, but registration is requested as seats are limited: <a href="http://bit.ly/2Bx2w9c">http://bit.ly/2Bx2w9c</a>.
