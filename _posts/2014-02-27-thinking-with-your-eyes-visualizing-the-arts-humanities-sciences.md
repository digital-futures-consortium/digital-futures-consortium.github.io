Thinking with Your Eyes explores the uses of visualization across disciplines and research methods. During this two-day symposium, experts will share tools, techniques and perspectives about what it means to interpret, learn and teach visually. The program includes lightning-round sessions, keynote presentations, roundtable discussions, and hands-on workshops.

Events will kick off with keynote speakers Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas, of Google’s “Big Picture” Research Group. Additional presenters come from such diverse fields as music, economics, astronomy, archaeology, and literature.

Whether you are a seasoned veteran or just starting to explore, this will be an opportunity to share, learn, and connect with others.
