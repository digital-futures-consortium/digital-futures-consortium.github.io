    Returning for a fifth year, ArtTechPsyche celebrates human expression at the intersection of technology and the arts through numerous immersive digital experiences, art installations, technology demos, and visionary speakers. This annual symposium run by Harvard's Digital Futures Consortium is a unique collaboration between <span class="s1"><a href="https://atg.fas.harvard.edu">Academic Technology for the FAS</a>, <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/">Harvard Art Museums</a> Department of Digital Infrastructure and Emerging Technology, <a href="http://darthcrimson.org/">Harvard Arts and Humanities Research Computing (DARTH)</a>, and the <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library</a>. We invite you to join us for ArtTechPsyche V on Friday, March 29, 2019 at Cabot Library in the Science Center.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Explore the creative process and its impact on emerging technologies. Discover the ways in which technology shapes us, and conversely, how the artist continually challenges and informs technological development. Interact with cutting edge art installations and software demos to experience the world in new ways. Meet like-minded faculty, staff, students, researchers, and colleagues of any skill level while exploring new projects and collaborations on and around campus.
