CAMBRIDGE, MA — The Digital Futures Consortium at Harvard (DFC), an active collaboration across the University since 2013, is disbanding at the end of this spring term. Initiated for the purpose of creating a network of technologists, faculty, researchers, and librarians engaged in the ongoing transformation of scholarship through innovative technology, the work the DFC has been providing on an informal basis has now become part of more formal initiatives on campus. Its workshops, like Visual Eloquence, and some of its informal hands-on basic training around digital tools — along with many of its current members — are now elements of the broader Digital Scholarship Support Group (DSSG).

The DFC’s Discovery Series, initiated two years ago with the opening of the new Cabot Library and its Discovery Bar, will continue under the auspices of the Cabot and Lamont Libraries and the DSSG. The Art Tech Psyche annual series that grew out of the DFC five years ago — the brainchild of Susan Berstler of the Cabot Science Library and Christopher Morse, formerly of Digital Arts and Humanities in Research Computing — is on track to continue with Cabot Library as a venue, thanks to the collaborative support of the Library, the DSSG, and other interested stakeholders.

The DFC was dedicated to sharing expertise across the global academic community, facilitating new forms and methods of research, and fostering collaborative projects that bring about field­-changing developments in scholarship. At a time when the campus was in the midst of reorganizing and initiating strategic plans for supporting digital scholarship, the DFC provided a needed forum for bringing greater awareness to new scholarship through new tools and methods of research, and its natural evolution toward becoming integrated into the work of more formal initiatives is an indication of its success.

There have been many staff, faculty and students that have helped in many ways with DFC events and activities in the past six years, and we thank everyone who has helped us at any point.
