<p>
  <em>Art Technology Psyche </em>celebrates human expression at the intersection of technology and the arts. <a href="http://www.darthcrimson.org/">Harvard Digital Arts and Humanities</a> (DARTH), in collaboration with the <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library</a> and the Digital Futures Consortium, invites you to participate in a day of immersive digital experiences, art exhibitions, technology demos, and visionary speakers on Thursday, April 23, 2015 at <a href="http://artsgarden.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do">Arts @ 29 Garden</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Explore the creative process and its impact on emerging technologies. Discover the ways in which technology shapes us, and conversely, how the artist continually challenges and informs technological development. Interact with cutting edge art installations and software demos to experience the world in new ways. Meet like-minded faculty, staff, students, researchers, and colleagues of any skill level while exploring new projects and collaborations on and around campus.
