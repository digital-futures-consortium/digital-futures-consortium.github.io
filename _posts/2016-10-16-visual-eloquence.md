<p>
  Join the Digital Futures Consortium for a participatory workshop to gain practical experience visualizing data and understanding the powerful role it plays in contemporary digital scholarship. The workshop will feature brief presentations, a hands-on exercise creating a data-driven narrative, and a discussion followed by pizza. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own data projects or challenges for an open lab session afterward. No programming expertise is necessary. Co-presented by Harvard Library, Harvard University Arts & Humanities Research Computing, and Digital History at Harvard.
