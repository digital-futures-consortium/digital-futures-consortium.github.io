Expanding the Boundaries of Authorship (2012-2017) was a group which supported new media scholarship at Harvard University. Members of the group offered support for faculty hoping to increase the use of media in the classroom, and for students seeking to enhance their media authorship skills. Expanding the Boundaries merged with the Digital Futures Consortium in early 2017 because an overlap in membership and similar missions focused on promoting and improving digital scholarship across Harvard&#8217;s campus. The Expanding the Boundaries of Authorship website (now archived) was available at [https://beta.blogs.harvard.edu/mediascholarship](https://beta.blogs.harvard.edu/mediascholarship); a copy of the site as of October 2018 can be accessed via the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181015184456/https://beta.blogs.harvard.edu/mediascholarship).

Expanding the Boundaries of Authorship goals were to:

  * Build a collaborative community engaged in integrating media into digital scholarship.
  * Identify best practices and provide access to resources for authoring with media.
  * Facilitate discussions on the pedagogy of multimedia assignments through seminars and workshops.
  * Explore possibilities for the visual representation of data through visualization/modeling software tools and uses in student assignments and projects.
